Past talk details are on our wiki on [http://corksec.com/.](http://corksec.com/) All people with any sort of an interest or level of knowledge in Security, Hacking and Emerging Technology are more than welcome to attend and feel free to bring like minded colleagues and friends.\n\nOur talks come from our community so if you have an idea for a topic (anything for 10-60 minutes) please email us at DefconCork@gmail.com . Whether you are an experienced presenter, or presenting for your first time - CorkSec is a great venue for it - and we are happy to help you prepare and mentor you.\n\nDoors open at 19:00 with talks starting at 19:15.\n\n**~~TALK 1: Trace Labs - Helping those who are lost - Gerard Barrett~~**\n~~Gerard helps to run a CTF group called Adorably Persistent Team who regularly contribute to Trace Labs events. Gerard will touch on the concept of OSINT and how it gets applied in a CTF for the event. The CTF runs on the premise of 'OsintForGood' where members of the public will crowdsource data points on open missing person cases which are then fed back into Law Enforcement. After appropriate sacrifices to the demo God's, there will be a short demo regarding it.~~\n\n**~~TALK 2: Business E-mail Compromise Part 1 : Detection, Analysis, Containment and Eradication - Paul Horgan~~**\n~~A real life case study of Business Email Compromise. Part 1 involves the detection, containment and eradication of an attacker. Part 2 will cover how to build back your security stronger to repel the attacks before they begin, and proactive steps you can take to secure the environment.~~",

Paul has taken some input from a collaborator and created a new talk about how you should really have Zero.Trust\n\n(Hint: You won't want to miss one, it has some unexpected twists)\n\n**TALK 2: Vortimo OSINT tool demo by Robert McArdle**\n[Vertigo OSINT Tool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vortimo-osint-tool/mnakbpdnkedaegeiaoakkjafhoidklnf) is a very useful browser extension that helps in online investigations, just about any research project, or simply gives you a Browser++. In this informal live demo I'll put it through its paces and explain how it works, and why you'll all be installing it in your Chrome browsers by the end of the evening",

But how do we attack them? This talk will examine API hacking from a bug bounty perspective, from recon to exploitation, with examples from my past findings to provide some real-world context for these bugs.\n\n**TALK 2: Cyber ranges for skills, training and research – an overview- Donna O’Shea, George O’Mahony (MTU)**\nIn this talk, Donna and George, will present an overview of what a cyber range is and why they are needed for cybersecurity skills, training and research. As part of their talk they will present an overview of Ireland’s only cyber range infrastructure, what services it can provide and the impact it has in terms of delivering world class cybersecurity education and research. A demonstration of MTU/UL/TU Dublin cyber range infrastructure will be provided as part of the talk.",

Based on the work of an MTU MSc in Cybersecurity student, the hope is to build upon the development and design frameworks that have been established so far with the goal of creating an open source solution to the research problems and having the research itself published in the near future.",
